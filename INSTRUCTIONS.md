# RESTful Practical JavaScript

Ready for it ... fullstack!  Your project this week is to refactor your finished code from Practical JavaScript into this starter repository.  The RESTful backend is provided, you'll be making the frontend app.  It should:

* Use ES6 `class`es
* Use `fetch` & `async`/`await`
* Store it's data in `db.json`
* Be in the `/public` folder
* Build from `/public/index.html`
* Be built in steps with branches, issues, and a project board
* Have a complete README

## Understanding REST

This project's backend is generated automatically using the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) module, the same module that is used to run the [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) API you used in class on Sunday.  Studying the [jsonplaceholder guide](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide.html) will be a help for this project.

Another way to understand REST and API's will be to watch the `db.json` file as you develop.  If you leave it open in VSC alongside the terminal window running your server, you will be able to watch your backend "database" change in real-time.  With each request logged to the terminal, there will be live change in the .json file.

* open `localhost:3000` in the browser

That's it!  You're now ready to study [this-to-fetch](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/this-to-fetch-example) and get started on your project.
